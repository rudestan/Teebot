Teebot is yet another Telegram bot API framework. It's main difference from other similar frameworks - ability
to create and maintain multi bots at the same time. Additionally it is well structured, easy to understand
and extend.

## Usage

For demo usage go to example bot directory - Bot/Example and rename template.config.json to config.json (it is in
.gitignore file). Replace bot token with your own.

Run ```php run.php -n Example```

## Current status

Bot is currently in early alpha status. It is fully usable, however any classes and functionality could be refactored and
changed during future updates. Additionally no documentation and tests available, it will be added in the nearest future.

## Capability

PHP 7.0 and higher
